## Kalman Filter for Weather Data Estimation
This repository provides an implementation of the Kalman Filter algorithm to estimate humidity, dew point, and temperature using weather data from 1995 to 2020. The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a series of measurements over time to estimate the state of a system while accounting for measurement noise and uncertainty.
### Data
The weather-raw_2020.csv files contains weather station data from 1995 to 2020.

### Kalman Filter
The Kalman-Filter-Toyon.ipynb details on how to use the weather data to emtimate different atmospheri vatiables such as tempetature, humidity and dew point.
